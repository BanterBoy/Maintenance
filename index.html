        This site has been created as an index for all the <a href="/menu/_pages/scripts/">scripts</a>, <a
            href="/menu/_pages/functions/">functions</a>, <a href="/menu/_pages/tools/">tools</a> and <a
            href="/menu/_pages/snippets/">snippets</a> that I have written, downloaded or amended during the time I
        have spent learning how to write PowerShell.<br>
        <br>
        I started learning PowerShell around the time PowerShell Version 2 was released (October 2009). At the time of
        it's release, like so many Admins, Batch files and VBScripts and a collection of third party applications had
        been the goto tools for much of the everyday work. Since PowerShell's release, it has grown into a ubiquitous
        product that can be used in many different information technology roles and not just for IT Administration.<br>
        <br>
        When I started out learning PowerShell, there were a handful of resources available. Some provided instruction
        on script writing and how to accomplish some Administration tasks and some provided generic scripts that could
        be used to produce reports on things like printing or active directory content/configuration.<br>
        <br>
        PowerShell has been available since Microsoft published the first <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell"></a>Monad</a> (PowerShell) public beta release on
        June 17, 2005. The once small collection of sites has grown into a wealth of information about this
        extraordinarily versatile product and include sites like <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, Microsoft's
        own <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/">Docs site</a> and numerous others which you may find
        listed under <a href="/menu/_pages/resources.html">resources.</a><br>
        <br>
        Hopefully, this site will also provide yet another place for Admins to come and find their next useful
        PowerShell tool.<br>
