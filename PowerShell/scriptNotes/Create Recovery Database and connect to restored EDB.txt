Create Recovery Database and connect to restored EDB

New-MailboxDatabase -Recovery -EdbFilePath "I:\TempRestore\Exchange Server\Overseas and Back Office\File\Overseas and Back Office.edb" -LogFolderPath "I:\TempRestore\Exchange Server\Overseas and Back Office\File" -Name RDB_661234

Get-MailboxDatabase RDB*

Get-MailboxDatabase RDB* | Mount-Database



Due to Database recovery being in "Dirty Shutdown" dbase should be repaired

Once Dbase has recovered, run New-MailboxRestoreRequest

Restore calendar to users mailbox.

New-MailboxRestoreRequest -SourceDatabase "RDB_661234" -SourceStoreMailbox "Lane, Alexandra" -IncludeFolders Calendar/* -T
argetMailbox "Lane, Alexandra"

(Use "DisplayName" as the alias does not appear in the restored dbase)
