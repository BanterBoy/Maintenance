Hello Steve,

As discussed this morning in the meeting, here are the details of the investigation into why the “Time Drifts” in both Data Centre’s in the current configuration.




NTP Sources & Time Drift

Assessment

The bods at Microsoft have performed some intensive testing using some newly created tools in order to establish the best methodology in configuring your environment to utilise an external “UTC Time Source”.

Moving on, here are links to the reference documents providing details on how this should now work.

Recommendations

NTP Time Server: LANTIME Stratum 1 Server for all Networks
https://www.meinbergglobal.com/english/products/ntp-time-server.htm

Sadly costs are approx £2000 for something like this but fortunately we do not rely on time that much it warrants the purchase of a Time Server, synchronising from the internet will be sufficient.

Suggested configurations




DC with PDC Role should be configured with the following command

w32tm /config /syncfromflags:manual /manualpeerlist:"0.pool.ntp.org 1.pool.ntp.org 2.pool.ntp.org 3.pool.ntp.org" /reliable:yes /update


reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\TimeProviders\VMICTimeProvider /v Enabled /t reg_dword /d 0

w32tm /config /syncfromflags:DOMHIER /update

net stop w32time & net start w32time

w32tm /resync /force

Discovering the Hierarchy

Troubleshoot a specific client; the first step is to understand its time source by using this w32tm command.

w32tm /query /status /verbose

(Example)
PS Scripts:\> w32tm /query /status /verbose
Leap Indicator: 0(no warning)
Stratum: 4 (secondary reference - syncd by (S)NTP)
Precision: -6 (15.625ms per tick)
Root Delay: 0.0743462s
Root Dispersion: 0.4685089s
ReferenceId: 0x0A00011C (source IP:  10.0.1.28)
Last Successful Sync Time: 28/04/2017 08:11:06
Source: FSI-AD01.fsi.co.uk
Poll Interval: 15 (32768s)

Phase Offset: 0.0003753s
ClockRate: 0.0156251s
State Machine: 2 (Sync)
Time Source Flags: 2 (Authenticated )
Server Role: 0 (None)
Last Sync Error: 0 (The command completed successfully.)
Time since Last Good Sync Time: 27087.6940441s




Next use Source entry from above and use the /StripChart parameter to find the next time source in the chain.

(Example)
PS Scripts:\> w32tm /stripchart /computer:10.0.1.28 /packetinfo /samples:1
Tracking 10.0.1.28 [10.0.1.28:123].
Collecting 1 samples.
The current time is 28/04/2017 15:59:55.

[NTP Packet]
Leap Indicator: 0(no warning)
Version Number: 3

Transmit Timestamp: 0xDCADD76B00A170FE (152058 14:59:55.0024634s - 28/04/2017 15:59:55)
[non-NTP Packet]
Destination Timestamp: Roundtrip Delay: 6666600 (+00.0066666s)
Local Clock Offset: -5270700 (-00.0052707s)


Also useful, the following command lists each domain controller it can find in the specified domain and prints a result which lets you determine each partner. This command will include machines that have been configured manually.


(Example)
PS Scripts:\> w32tm /monitor /domain:fsi.co.uk
DC4FSIAD01.fsi.co.uk[192.168.22.100:123]:
    ICMP: 10ms delay
    NTP: error ERROR_TIMEOUT - no response from server in 1000ms
FSI-AD01.fsi.co.uk *** PDC ***[10.0.1.28:123]:
    ICMP: 6ms delay
    NTP: +0.0000000s offset from FSI-AD01.fsi.co.uk
        RefID: time.videxio.net [176.58.109.199]
        Stratum: 3
DC5FSIAD01.fsi.co.uk[192.168.43.100:123]:
    ICMP: error IP_REQ_TIMED_OUT - no response in 1000ms
    NTP: +0.0099610s offset from FSI-AD01.fsi.co.uk
        RefID: FSI-AD01.fsi.co.uk [10.0.1.28]
        Stratum: 4

Warning:
Reverse name resolution is best effort. It may not be
correct since RefID field in time packets differs across
NTP implementations and may not be using IP addresses.


Virtualized Domains

Virtualized Domains - In order to control Virtualized Domain Controllers in Windows 2012R2 so that they synchronize time with their domain, rather than with the Hyper-V host, you can disable this registry entry. For the PDC, you don’t want to disable the entry as the Hyper-V host will deliver the most stable time source. The registry entry requires that you restart the w32time service after it is changed.

reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\TimeProviders\VMICTimeProvider /v Enabled /t reg_dword /d 0
