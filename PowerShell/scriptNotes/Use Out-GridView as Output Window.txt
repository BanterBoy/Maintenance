Use Out-GridView as Output Window
All Versions
Typically, Out-GridView opens a window and displays whatever you pipe into the cmdlet:

PS C:\> Get-Service | Out-GridView 
However, with a little trick Out-GridView becomes even more versatile. You can pipe information to the same output window whenever you want to.

First, get yourself an instance of Out-GridView that thinks it is running in a pipeline:
Now, you can output whatever you want by calling “Process”. Each call to Process() is like piping an element to the cmdlet:
When you are done, call End() to end the pipeline:
This way, you could log information to a grid view or use it as a generic output window that shows results to the user.

$pipeline = { Out-GridView }.GetSteppablePipeline()
$pipeline.Begin($true)
$pipeline.Process('Hello this is awesome!')
Start-Sleep -Seconds 4
$pipeline.Process('You can output any time...')
$pipeline.End()
